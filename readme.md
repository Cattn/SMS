## Cloning

To clone to the current directory: `git clone https://github.com/Cattn/SMS .`

## How to deploy?

### Install Dependencies

`npm i`

`npm i -g concurrently`

### Run Start Script

`npm run startall`

> Ensure you run this script from `SMS/`.

## Configuration

A configuration will be generated by default in `api/config.json` on first start. All values can be manually changed (no server restart needed) or modified in the settings tab of SMS.

## Build Scripts

### Normal

For a normal build & start, run `npm run startall`

### Lightweight

There are 2 options for "lightweight" start scripts.

1. Start, only re-build the server

- `npm run ncuStart`

2. Start, only re-build the client

- `npm run nsuStart`

To start the server without re-building anything, run `npm run nobStart`

## Notes

### Lightweight Servers

The lightweight scripts intended for low-power servers where builds are expected to take significantly long times. When updates are released, they will be denoted with the following:

1. `-s`, A server update
2. `-c`, A client update
3. `-b`, Both the client & server were updated.

If you need, you should use this as a guide for starting the server.

### Warning

This service is **NOT** intended to be publicly available on your server. Please make sure ports 1337 and 5823 are not reachable from the internet.

## F&Q

### How do I set this up so I can quickly share links?

Create a simple host.js file that serves `/uploads`, and run it on your server.

Here's an example:

```js
import express from 'express';
import path from 'path';
import * as fs from 'fs';
import http from 'node:http';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
import { dirname } from 'path';
const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = dirname(__filename);

const app = express();

const server = http.createServer(app);

const uploadsPath = path.join(__dirname, 'SMS', 'uploads');
if (fs.existsSync(uploadsPath)) {
	app.use('/uploads', express.static(uploadsPath));
	app.use('/uploads/*', (req, res) => {
		res.status(404).send('404, no media found!');
	});
	app.use('/SMS/upload/*', (req, res) => {
		res.status(404).send('404, did you mean `/SMS/uploads`?');
	});
}

server.listen(3000);
```

Then, simply make this server available at port 443 using your preferred web-server.
